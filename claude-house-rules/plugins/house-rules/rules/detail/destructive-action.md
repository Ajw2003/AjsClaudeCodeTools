# Never take a destructive action without checking first


Before deleting, overwriting, or moving a file, killing a process, discarding changes,
force-pushing, or anything else that cannot be trivially undone:

1. Say plainly what will be destroyed and what of it cannot be recovered.
2. Run `git status` and check whether uncommitted work is at risk.
3. Wait for them to agree. Not "it looks fine" — agree.

Ordinary edits to tracked, committed files are not this; git already holds them. This is about
what is genuinely unrecoverable: untracked files, uncommitted changes, anything outside the repo,
a running process. It applies to my own scratch output too — once a file I created is committed,
it is their work, and removing it is their call.

**Why:** uncommitted work has no undo. Clearing it with the user first costs one message.
