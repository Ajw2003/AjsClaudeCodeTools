# Today — 2026-09-29

Built "open source first" and the hardware-aware machine profile, and fixed the Unity standards
overrun that `verify.py` had never measured. See the dated entry in
[`Decisions.md`](../6-decisions/Decisions.md) and the plan in
[`2026-09-29-local-first-free-first.md`](../plans/2026-09-29-local-first-free-first.md).

## What was done

- **New core rule.** "Open source first; paid is the last resort", with a five-rung ladder, and
  `rules/detail/free-first.md` holding the ladder, the build-your-own estimate for Pro/Max, and
  one example. "Find out what machine you are on" now says detected hardware is the local budget;
  `rules/detail/environment.md` says what "doesn't fit" means.
- **Unity rule moved out of the core (Option B).** It now lives in
  `rules/standards/csharp-unity-standards.md`, so only Unity projects load it. That document is
  split: a small always-injected core plus `rules/standards/csharp-unity-detail.md` (six sections
  moved unchanged, checked with a diff). `inject` is 8,943 of 9,000.
- **Unity standards overrun fixed.** `standards` emitted 9,832 chars for a Unity-only project and
  13,376 for Unity + Node; now 5,782 and 9,326 (budget 9,500). `verify.py` measures both, which it
  never did before.
- **Profile detects hardware and plan.** CPU, RAM, GPU/VRAM, free disk and the Claude plan, at
  runtime, each with a timeout and a "not detected (reason)" line. On a remote session it is
  labelled as the sandbox's, and the local budget is the user's machine.
- **Tests.** New `verify.py` cases for all of the above; each fails against the previous code.
- **Docs.** `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/4-systems/hook-engine.md`, `Decisions.md`,
  `ProjectState.md`, the plan.
- **Version bump.** `2.45.0` to `2.46.0` in `plugin.json`.

## What to do next, in order

1. Check on a real local machine whether `claude auth status --json` reports a plan (it does not
   in a cloud session), and run the profile on macOS and Windows: those probe branches were not
   run.
2. Tell `Ajw2003/Coding-Standards` about the split of `csharp-unity-standards.md`, or the next
   `tools/sync_standards.py` run reverts it.
3. Run `/house-rules:plain-docs` on the remaining system docs (`verify-suites.md`,
   `plugin-distribution.md`, `offshoot-plugins.md`) — still open.
4. Everything still open in [`ProjectState.md`](../3-state/ProjectState.md)'s Cross-cutting
   section.
